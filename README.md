# Runners-List

In this project, I aimed to develop an application that keeps the list of runners. I used Asp.Net MVC architecture in my project.


I aimed to use MSSql as database. 
I prepared a table as a front without going into too much detail. 
On the back, I used C # to do all the work related to exporting and listing the data in my table.


If it comes to practice, the names, ages, genders, total duration, distance and average speed of the persons are included in the Runner table.


By default, there is a sort by average speed in listing or ranking the table. 
If the person wishes, they can also change this as distance or total time.


It can also separate the table according to age groups.


This is my project, I hope you found it useful.
