# Runners-List
In this project, I developed a small application that keeps the list of runners. 
I have created a table showing the names, gender, total duration, distance and average speed of people. 
In the table, you can sort people by average speed, total time and distance. 
I also grouped people according to their age. 
I hope it has been a useful and neat project.
